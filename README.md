###nuke_card_machine

nuke_card_machine is a small tool to create and place axis, card  and card3d nodes inside 
The Foundry's [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke) application.

The placing is based on a rendered world position pass and screenspace coordinates are taken from
RotoPaints strokes. Therefore it is possible to scrib through the sequence and mark all card positions 
while receiving a visual reference for distribution.  

A short demo on vimeo is available [here](https://vimeo.com/378891176).
